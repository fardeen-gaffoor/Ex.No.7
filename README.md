### **AIM**

To develop a **prompt-based application** using **ChatGPT** that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries — demonstrating how **prompt engineering** can be used to build a personalized **AI-powered productivity assistant**.

---

### **AI TOOLS REQUIRED**

* OpenAI ChatGPT
* Python 3.x (optional for simulation)
* Streamlit / Command Line Interface (for user simulation)
* Internet connection

---

### **EXPLANATION**

The goal of this experiment is to create a **personal productivity assistant** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through **prompt-based interaction**.
The assistant should accept user commands in natural language, manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, and suggest wellness tips — adapting over time based on user preferences.

This experiment helps understand how **prompt design** impacts the quality, usefulness, and personalization of AI interactions.

### **PROMPT DESIGN**

**Main Prompt:**

> “Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries.
> The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time.”

**Sub-Prompts (Examples):**

1. **Task Management Prompt:**
   “Add a new task: Complete AI lab record by 5 PM today.”
   “Show all pending tasks for tomorrow.”

2. **Smart Scheduler Prompt:**
   “Schedule a meeting with the project team at 10 AM on Friday.”
   “Remind me to submit the report two hours before the deadline.”

3. **Wellness Tip Prompt:**
   “Give me a quick wellness tip for today.”
   “Suggest something to reduce stress while studying.”

4. **General Query Prompt:**
   “What are some ways to improve focus during study sessions?”
   “Tell me a motivational quote for today.”

---

### **PROCEDURE**

1. **Define Core Requirements:**

   * Personal productivity assistant with daily task organization, reminders, and wellness suggestions.
   * Must understand natural language inputs.
   * Should adapt responses to user preferences.

2. **Design Prompts:**

   * Create structured prompts for each function (tasks, scheduling, tips, queries).
   * Test different prompt phrasings for optimal responses.

3. **Implement System (Simulation):**

   * Use ChatGPT (or Python interface) to send prompts and receive responses.
   * Simulate a command-line chatbot or Streamlit web interface for interactions.

4. **Adaptation Feature (Optional):**

   * Store user preferences (e.g., preferred time for wellness tips).
   * Modify responses based on interaction history.

5. **Evaluate Outputs:**

   * Observe how the assistant handles multitasking, priority management, and contextual understanding.

**Personal Productivity Assistant Features:**

#### 🗓 **Daily Task Manager**

* Accepts tasks in natural language:
  *“Remind me to call mom at 6 PM.”*
* Organizes by **priority**, **category**, and **deadline**.
* Provides **daily summaries** and **pending task alerts**.

#### ⏰ **Smart Scheduler**

* Schedules events and reminders contextually.
* Detects **overlapping appointments** and suggests best available time slots.
* Can display a **weekly planner summary**.

#### 💪 **Wellness Tips Generator**

* Suggests daily health and productivity tips, e.g.,
  *“Take a 5-minute break every hour to rest your eyes.”*
* Adapts suggestions over time based on user interest and engagement.

#### 💬 **General Query Responder**

### **SAMPLE INTERACTION**

**User:** “Add task — Prepare AI lab record by 6 PM.”
**Assistant:** “Got it! I’ve added your task ‘Prepare AI lab record’ with a reminder for 6 PM.”

**User:** “Give me a wellness tip.”
**Assistant:** “Stay hydrated! Drink at least 2 liters of water today to maintain energy levels.”

**User:** “Remind me to take a break at 3 PM.”
**Assistant:** “Sure! I’ll remind you at 3 PM to take a short 10-minute break.”

---

### **CONCLUSION**

The experiment successfully demonstrated how **prompt-based applications** can be created using **LLMs like ChatGPT**.
Through well-structured prompt engineering, a **personal productivity assistant** was simulated that manages tasks, schedules, wellness tips, and general queries.

This exercise enhanced understanding of **context-aware AI**, **creative prompt design**, and **real-world adaptability** in LLMs.

---

### **RESULT**

✅ The corresponding **prompt-based personal assistant** was successfully designed and executed.
Students gained practical knowledge in developing **LLM-driven applications** and understanding **prompt optimization for productivity-based use cases**.
